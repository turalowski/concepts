2. Lexical environment
In JS lexical scope (available data + variables where the function was defined) determines our available variables. Not where the function is called (dynamic scope)

3. Hoisting

JavaScript has the concept of hoisting because it allows functions and variables to be declared before they are used in the code. This can make the code easier to read and write, especially for developers who are used to other programming languages that have similar features.

Hoisting in JavaScript works by moving variable and function declarations to the top of their respective scopes before the code is executed. This means that they can be used in the code before they are actually declared.
